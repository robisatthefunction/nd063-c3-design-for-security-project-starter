# What additional architectural change can be made to reduce the internet facing attack surface of the web application instance.
Set up a WAF in the VPC to address the OWASP top 10 security risks

# Assuming the IAM permissions for the S3 bucket are still insecure, would creating VPC private endpoints for S3 prevent the unauthorized access to the secrets bucket.
Yes you could create a policy for the secret bucket that does not allow resources within the VPC to have access to objects within the bucket.

# Will applying default encryption setting to the s3 buckets encrypt the data that already exists?
No, you will have to use Amazon S3 Batch Operations to do that.

# What would happen if the original cloud formation templates are applied to this environment.
That would cause an error?
