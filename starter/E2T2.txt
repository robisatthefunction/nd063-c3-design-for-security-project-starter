Research and analyze which of the vulnerabilities appear to be related to the code that was deployed for the environment in this project.
1. The security groups for our Web App and the Attack instance EC2 instances (security groups WebAppSG and AttackInstanceSG) are allowing all ingress traffic to port 22.
2. The WebApp Ec2 instance is configured to allow users to log in with root credentials over SSH without having to use a command authenticated by a public key
3. For the WebApp and Attack EC2 Instance process 'systemd-netwo' is listening on UDP port 68 which is associated with 'DHCP' and is reachable from the internet

Bonus - provide recommendations on how to remediate the vulnerabilities.
1. Remove the rule that allows all ingress traffic from both security groups
2. To reduce the likelihood of a successful brute-force attack, we recommend that you configure your EC2 instance to prevent root account logins over SSH. To disable SSH root account logins, set PermitRootLogin to 'no' in /etc/ssh/sshd_config and restart sshd. When logged in as a non-root user, you can use sudo to escalate privileges when necessary. If you want to allow public key authentication with a command associated with the key, you can set **PermitRootLogin** to 'forced-commands-only'.
3. You can edit the WebAppSG and AttackInstanceSG Security Groups to remove access from the internet on port 68
